Installation:
1. Use command-line to clone files from github.

		git clone https://github.com/shrenikrajvijay/Cost-To-Company

2. Set up the database. Change directory to the cloned folder and issue the following command to import the database,

		 mysql -u username -p ibm < ibm.sql
	
	If mysql is not installed, then install mysql and run the mysql daemon before proceeding with next steps. The mysql daemon should run on standard port which is 3306.
	After MySql daemon is running, create a database with name 'ibm' and run the above command from command line. It will import the sample database. Here, username is the name that is specific to your database settings. If your settings has password, then specify password after -p. ibm is the name of the database specific to this application. ibm.sql is the file that will be used to make the database environment. It has the tables, structure and sample data.

3. Install node and npm if it is not already installed.

4. Start the server so that requests can be made,

		node ./server.js
	
	Here, server.js is the server daemon that listens for request and responds to those requests. The port it listens on is 8080.

	If running the above command gives out error, then install mysql and express module 

		npm install mysql
		npm install express

	If everything runs fine, then it should output the following,
		Running on http://localhost:8080

5. After all the above is set up, issue reques to server by typing in the following inside the web browser,
	- localhost:8080

If everything went well, then you should see the web page.
